Theme: Beneath the surface


The outside world has been assumed to be in a nuclear fallout for years. As such civization has to be under the surface, hidden for ages.
This is a rogue like type game.

Player: A mole called Doug the Digger
Desiring freedom, yet also fat and hungry(No, not really - he really just likes eating), Doug heads in search of the fabled Surface


First:
We need to make a character that can move, up down left right.
A health system for the character.

Then, we can make enemies that spawn and move towards the character.


Tunnels are the roguelike feature

Enemies are in tunnels

Levels? How do those work? 
Maybe - kill all enemies in level, proceed to next level

Attacks (and powers) (by player):

Ideas:


Swallow - can use 2x per level - can only use on certain enemies

(OP power) Cave in - crumble a tunnel, crush enemies in that tunnel. Can use 1x per level. For cave in, mole lobs/throws a object/bomb(kaboom) upwards at slight an angle, and when it hits the ceiling, it crumbles down and 

Dig Down 



Attacks(By enemy):
Flashbang(Flashbangs, blinds )
